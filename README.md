# ABB-PickAndPlace-SpeedMonitoring

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents the design and simulation of a **Pick & Place application** using **ABB RobotStudio**.  
The main innovation is the implementation of **Speed Monitoring**, which ensures that the robot operates safely and efficiently while performing repetitive pick & place cycles.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Develop and simulate a **Pick & Place task** in ABB RobotStudio.  
- Implement **Speed Monitoring** to guarantee safe operation in restricted areas.  
- Demonstrate compliance with industrial safety standards.  
- Optimize the trajectory for faster and smoother movements.
